          Personally, I feel as though parasocial relationships have a deep impact on society. Corporation spend a lot of money shoving brands
          and products down our throats chasing profits. With the modern advent of celebreity brand deals, corporations put a face to
          certain brands and buidl special relationships. It becomes impossible in modern society to NOT know certain names, faces, and brands.
          This becomes dangerous as the next generation is raised within this society. These things can become engrained in an unhealthy way,

           Stalking: <br> <br>
           Streamers, celebtrities, and public figures often get their addresses leaked, which can lead to stalking, unwanted visitors, etc
