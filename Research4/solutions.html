            <h3>Data Pools</h3>
            <p>
                AI relies on data pools to train their decision-making capabilities. Better, non-biased data is needed
                if AI is to be viable in policing/judicial systems. Ensuring diversity in training data can help mitigate
                biases. Regular audits and updates of data pools are necessary to maintain accuracy and fairness.

                Developing transparent AI systems can help build trust and understanding. Implementing clear guidelines
                and standards for AI use in the legal system. Establishing accountability mechanisms to address errors or
                biases in AI decisions.
